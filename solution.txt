Please add your pseudocode to this file

FUNCTION consecutiveSubstrings(string)
    Initialize result as an empty array
    FOR i FROM 0 TO length of string - 1
        FOR e FROM i + 1 TO length of string
            ADD substring of string from index i up to (but not including) index e TO result
        END FOR
    END FOR
    RETURN result
END FUNCTION



And a written explanation of your solution

I used the .slice() method to generate all consecutive substrings of a string.

I created two nested for loops:

The outer loop (variable i) represents the starting index of the substring.

The inner loop (variable e) represents the ending index + 1 of the substring, because
.slice(start, end) includes start but excludes end (the ending index with be end - 1).

The loop conditions follow the logic of .slice():

Outer loop: i < string.length → ensures all starting positions are included.

Inner loop: e <= string.length → ensures the last character can be included.

Inside the inner loop, string.slice(i, e) extracts the substring from index i up to (but not
including) index e, and I add it to the result array.

Finally, the function returns result, which contains all consecutive substrings.

The type of algorithm is brute-force / nested loops

Time complexity: O(n²), because we have two nested loops iterating over the string.
